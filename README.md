## Requirements

* Make sure your YML files are of the format `<locale>.yml` and just one YML file per locale. e.g. `en_GB.yml`

## Known issues

* If you import nested YML files with pretty new line (pipe) syntax, it will replace new lines with \r\n

## Thanks/Credits

* Big thanks to StartBootstrap for a few styles for the admin: https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-sb-admin
